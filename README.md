About this project
------------------
I have been slow to embrace Wordpress, and I was kind of interested in
doing a couple of projects with Twitter Bootstrap. First, I poked around
to see what was available, and started to settle upin the Roots Theme. I
admired quite a bit of the Roots options, but it didn't really suit my
tastes.

So I decided to just roll my own, co-opting as much as I could. I thouhgt
it would have the added benefit of encouraging me to gain familiarity
with the workings of Wordpress. A long the way, I added a few other
"features," and decided some other folks might like to take a look at
some of the logic, if not the underlying code. So I am putting it out
there.

This is more of playground for me than anything, and at this time, I have
no intention of contributing it to any collections. It's also at some
very initial stages. Definitely only suitable for developers at this point;
I have quite a bit of clean up work to do, more work on the markup, and
some additional features I would like to integrate.

Regardless, I have no intention of making this a "polished" theme. If
someone wants to make use of it for something, fine by me. It's just that
I hope you are far more aesthetically gifted than me, and I want to
encourage your creativity. I supoose that is a bit ironic, considering
I am using Bootstrap.

Custom Login
------------
The theme has the ability to deploy a custom login page. Due to the changes
in Wordpress 3.6, I don't currently recommend that you use that feature. I
have looked at all of the changes closely enough, but it appears to me
that use of this feature is ill-advised at present.
